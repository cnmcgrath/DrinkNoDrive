# DrinkNoDrive
MHacks IV prize winning project

Drink No Drive is a hackathon project with the goal of ending drunk driving. The app monitors alcohol concumption based on purchased drinks and body metrics the user gives before hand. 

When the user is too drunk and tries to leave the bar, the app alerts the user not to drive and calles a cab through the user's Uber account. 

ToDo:
+ Add Widgit extension
+ Add Apple Watch extension
+ Add support for new Uber API's
